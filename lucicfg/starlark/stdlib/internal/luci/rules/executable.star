    """Defines an executable that runs a particular recipe.

    Recipes are python-based DSL for defining what a builder should do, see
    [recipes-py](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/luci/recipes-py/).

    Builders refer to such executable recipes in their `executable` field, see
    luci.builder(...). Multiple builders can execute the same recipe (perhaps
    passing different properties to it).

    Recipes are located inside cipd packages called "recipe bundles". Typically
    the cipd package name with the recipe bundle will look like:

        infra/recipe_bundles/chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/build

    Recipes bundled from internal repositories are typically under

        infra_internal/recipe_bundles/...

    But if you're building your own recipe bundles, they could be located
    elsewhere.

    The cipd version to fetch is usually a lower-cased git ref (like
    `refs/heads/master`), or it can be a cipd tag (like `git_revision:abc...`).

    A luci.recipe(...) with some particular name can be redeclared many times as
    long as all fields in all declaration are identical. This is helpful when
    luci.recipe(...) is used inside a helper function that at once declares
    a builder and a recipe needed for this builder.

    Args:
      ctx: the implicit rule context, see lucicfg.rule(...).
      name: name of this recipe entity, to refer to it from builders. If
        `recipe` is None, also specifies the recipe name within the bundle.
        Required.
      cipd_package: a cipd package name with the recipe bundle. Supports the
        module-scoped default.
      cipd_version: a version of the recipe bundle package to fetch, default
        is `refs/heads/master`. Supports the module-scoped default.
      recipe: name of a recipe inside the recipe bundle if it differs from
        `name`. Useful if recipe names clash between different recipe bundles.
        When this happens, `name` can be used as a non-ambiguous alias, and
        `recipe` can provide the actual recipe name. Defaults to `name`.
      use_bbagent: a boolean to override Buildbucket's global configuration. If
        True, then builders with this recipe will always use bbagent. If False,
        then builders with this recipe will temporarily stop using bbagent (note
        that all builders are expected to use bbagent by ~2020Q3). Defaults to
        unspecified, which will cause Buildbucket to pick according to it's own
        global configuration. See [this bug](crbug.com/1015181) for the global
        bbagent rollout. Supports the module-scoped default.
