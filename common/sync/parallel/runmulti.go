// RunMulti initiates a nested RunMulti operation. It invokes an entry function,
// passing it a MultiRunner instance bound to the supplied constraints. Any
// nested parallel operations scheduled through that MultiRunner will not
// starve each other regardless of execution order.
//
// This is useful when sharing the same outer Runner constraints with multiple
// tiers of parallel operations. A naive approach would be to re-use a Runner's
// WorkC() or Run() functions, but this can result in deadlock if the outer
// functions consume all available resources running their inner payloads,
// forcing their inner payloads to block forever.
//
// The supplied Context will be monitored for cancellation. If the Context is
// canceled, new work dispatch will be inhibited. Any methods added to the
// work channel will not be executed, and RunMulti will treat them as if they
// ran and immediately returned the Context's Err() value.
