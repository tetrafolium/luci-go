// Package versions allows processes to report string-valued metrics with
// versions of various libraries they link with.
//
// The metric is named 'luci/components/version', and it has single field
// 'component' that defines the logical name of the component whose version is
// reported by the metric value.
//
// Having such metrics allows to easily detect processes that use stale code in
// production.
//
// Various go packages can register their versions during 'init' time, and all
// registered version will be flushed to monitoring whenever 'Report' is called.
