// Whoever hosts the cron machine is supposed to store this state in some
// persistent store between events. It's mutated by Machine. So the usage
// pattern is:
//   * Deserialize State, construct Machine instance with it.
//   * Invoke some Machine method (e.g Enable()) to advance the state.
//   * Acknowledge all actions emitted by the machine (see Machine.Actions).
//   * Serialize the mutated state (available in Machine.State).
//
// If appropriate, all of the above should be done in a transaction.
//
// Machine assumes that whoever hosts it handles TickLaterAction with following
// semantics:
//   * A scheduled tick can't be "unscheduled".
//   * A scheduled tick may come more than one time.
//
// So the machine just ignores ticks it doesn't expect.
//
// It supports "absolute" and "relative" schedules, see 'schedule' package for
// definitions.
