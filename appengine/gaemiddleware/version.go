// Version is a semantic version of base luci-go GAE library.

// reported to monitoring as 'luci/components/version' string metric with
// 'component' field set to 'github.com/tetrafolium/luci-go/appengine/gaemiddleware'.
//
// It allows to track what GAE apps use what version of the library, so it's
// easier to detect stale code running in production.
