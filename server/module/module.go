	// requests. If it returns nil, the server context won't be changed.
	//
	// The module may use the context (with all values available there) and the
	// given Host interface to register itself in various server systems. It must
	// not retain 'host': the object it points to becomes invalid after Initialize
	// finishes and using it causes panics. This is intentional.
