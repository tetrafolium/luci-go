// Package distributor contains all the adaptors for the various supported
// distributor protocols. At a high level, it works like this:
//   * Quests specify a distributor configuration by name as part of their
//     identity.
//   * When an Execution for that Quest NeedsExecution, DM reads configuration
//     (distributor.proto) from luci-config. This configuration is stored
//     as part of the Execution so that for the duration of a given Exectuion,
//     DM always interacts with the same distributor in the same way (barring
//     code changes in DM's adapter logic itself).
//   * DM uses the selected distributor implementation to start a task and
//     record its Token. Additionally, the distributor SHOULD publish on DM's
//     pubsub topic to update DM's state. When publishing updates, the
//     distributor MUST include the token returned from PrepareTopic (or else
//     the published update will be ignored).
//   * When DM gets a hit on pubsub, it will load the Execution, load its cached
//     distributor configuration, and then call HandleNotification for the
//     adapter to parse the notification body and return the state of the task.
//
// Adding a new distributor requires:
//   * Add a new subdir of protos with the configuration proto for the new
//     distributor. Each distributor implementation must have its own unique
//     Config message.
//   * Add a matching subdir of this package for the implementation of the
//     distributor.
//   * In the implementation, add a Register method that registers the
//     implementation with this package appropriately.
//   * In the DM frontend, import your new package implementation and run its
//     Register method.

	// Scheduling the same execution ID multiple times SHOULD return the same
	// Token. It's OK if this doesn't happen, but only one of the scheduled tasks
	// will be able to invoke ActivateExecution; the other one(s) will
	// early-abort and/or timeout.
	//
	// If this returns a non-Transient error, the Execution will be marked as
	// Rejected with the returned error message as the 'Reason'.

	// The various time durations, if non-zero, will be used verbatim for DM to
	// timeout that phase of the task's execution. If the task's execution times
	// out in the 'STOPPING' phase, DM will poll the distributor's GetStatus
	// method up to 3 times with a 30-second gap to attempt to retrieve the final
	// information. After more than 3 times, DM will give up and mark the task as
	// expired.
	//
	// If the distributor doesn't intend to use Pubsub for notifying DM about the
	// final status of the job, set pollTimeout to the amount of time you want DM
	// to wait before polling GetStatus. e.g. if after calling FinishAttempt or
	// EnsureGraphData your distributor needs 10 seconds before it can correctly
	// respond to a GetStatus request, you should set pollTimeout to >= 10s.
	// Otherwise pollTimeout should be set fairly high (e.g. 12 hours) as a hedge
	// against a broken pubsub notification pipeline.

	// allows DM to more proactively update the graph state (and unblock waiting
